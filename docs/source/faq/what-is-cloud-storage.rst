What is Cloud Storage?
======================

Google `Cloud Storage <https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/introduction>`__ is Google's object
(file) storage service.
Objects are stored in buckets.
Buckets have a flat namespace (meaning there is no such thing as a directory or folder), but
folder-style functionality is provided by most of the access tools (e.g., console and APIs) which
interpret folder hierarchies from slashes in the object name.
