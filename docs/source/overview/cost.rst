Note on Costs
==============

You do not need to setup billing to complete our tutorials.
The Google Cloud services pricing structure includes a Free Tier,
and the usage incurred from our tutorials stays well within these limits.

You cannot be charged unless you explicitly enable billing for your project
and setup a billing account.

For users who wish to process volumes of data larger than the Free Tier quotas,
Google's pricing structure is "pay-as-you-go"
and you only pay for what you actually use.
See the links below for more information.

Some pricing examples (as of Aug. 2021):
