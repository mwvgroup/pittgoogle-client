Initial Setup

.. toctree::
    :maxdepth: 1
    :hidden:

    install-pittgoogle
    gcp-setup
    cost
    adv-setup

To get started, you'll need to complete 2 steps:

#.  :doc:`install-pittgoogle`

#.  :doc:`Obtain authentication credentials from Google Cloud <gcp-setup>`

These steps are very similar to those required to connect to most other
astronomical alert brokers.
The difference here is that you will obtain credentials from Google Cloud directly
rather than from the Pitt-Google broker.

You may also be interested in the following:

-   :doc:`cost`

-   :doc:`Advanced setup instructions <adv-setup>` (most users will
    not need this)
