Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST)
======================================

Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time is an upcoming wide-field, optical survey that will scan the entire
visible southern sky every few days for a decade in six bands: u, g, r, i, z, and y. It will produce an alert stream of
astronomical transients detected by difference imaging at an average rate of 10^7 alerts per night.
